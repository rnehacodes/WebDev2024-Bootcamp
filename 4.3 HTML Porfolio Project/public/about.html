<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a software test engineer as of now. But also in the process of becoming SOFTWARE ENGINEER.</p>

<p>Since March 2022, when I landed into my first job, I explored the world of software products. How software products are made and developed and what are the various roles and processes in it. While working in the role of a software test engineer, I found myself inclined towards the development process fo softwares too. Watching my peers learning new things, I also got motivated to learn software development and thereby acquiring the vast skill set of software engineering domain.</p>

<p>With time, I am learning new skills required to become a software developer. And eventually i would like to become a packaged software engineer who possess various skills form all the facets of software engineering.</p>
